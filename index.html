<p>Are you looking for an on-screen keyboard that will work with your phone's small screen and slow CPU?
Do you know or are you willing to learn Morse code? If you answered "yes" to both of these questions,
then this may be the keyboard for you!</p>

<p>DotDash Keyboard is a drop-in replacement for Android's on-screen keyboard. It allows you to enter text
via untimed Morse code, using three main buttons: Dot, Dash, and Space (as well as Shift and Delete).</p>

<p>DotDash features an extended version of Morse code which replicates all of the characters on a standard
QWERTY keyboard. For more information see the DotDash Keyboard wiki: </p>
