As an Input Method, DotDash Keyboard doesn't show up in your Applications list. Instead, you'll need to activate it from your phone's settings, and then it will simply appear whenever you invoke the on-screen keyboard. Specific setup instructions may vary depending on your version of Android. For Android 2.3 (which I have), you need to do this:

  1. Go to your phone's "Settings" screen
  1. Go to "Language & keyboards"
  1. In the list of keyboards on the bottom of the screen, tick the checkbox next to "DotDash Keyboard"
  1. You'll see a warning message telling you that a soft keyboard could be acting as a keylogger. Since DotDash Keyboard has no permission to access the network or store data, you can feel fairly safe. If you feel paranoid, feel free to review and compile the code yourself.


Now the keyboard will be available as an option, but you must still select it.

  1. Launch an application that has a text field in which you can type. For instance, the text messaging application
  1. Long-press in a text field until an options dialog pops up. In this dialog, select "Input methods"
  1. You'll see a list of your active Input Methods. Select "DotDash Keyboard"

Should you want to switch to another keyboard layout, just long-press on a text field and bring up the "Input methods" again.
