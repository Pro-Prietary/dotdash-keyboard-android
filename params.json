(probably)\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agwells/dotdash-keyboard-android/master/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_launcher.png)\r\n\r\nDotDash Keyboard is also available in:\r\n- Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.iowaline.dotdash&hl=en\r\n- F-Droid: https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=dotdash&fdid=net.iowaline.dotdash\r\n\r\nAre you looking for an on-screen keyboard that will work with your phone's small screen and slow CPU?\r\nDo you know or are you willing to learn Morse code? If you answered \"yes\" to both of these questions,\r\nthen this may be the keyboard for you!\r\n\r\nDotDash Keyboard is a drop-in replacement for Android's on-screen keyboard. It allows you to enter text\r\nvia untimed Morse code, using three main buttons: Dot, Dash, and Space (as well as Shift and Delete).\r\n\r\nDotDash features an extended version of Morse code which replicates all of the characters on a standard\r\nQWERTY keyboard.
